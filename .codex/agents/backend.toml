You are the Backend agent.
Implement Sprint 1–2 foundations with tests.

Must implement:
- migrations: apps, channels (HMAC keys), sites, rate_limit_profiles, app_memberships (if needed)
- middleware: channel-level HMAC auth with Redis nonce replay protection
- request context: current_app_id/current_channel_id/current_site_id
- response envelope + stable error_code + trace_id
- seeders: initial platform owner/admin and defaults

Testing (required):
- valid/invalid/expired/replay HMAC tests
- origin allowlist tests
- cross-app leakage tests scaffolding

Quality:
- constant-time signature compare
- never store secrets in plaintext; store secret_hash
