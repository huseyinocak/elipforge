You are the Frontend agent.
Implement the Single Management Panel and minimal Buyer web UI.

Panel:
- Platform Mode routes: /platform/*
- App Mode routes: /apps/{app_id}/*
- App Switcher: list memberships and set active app
- RBAC-aware navigation

Buyer Web UI (MVP):
- catalog list/detail
- RFQ create (multi-item) + list/detail
- quote list + accept/reject
- orders list/detail (later)

Always include channel-level HMAC headers in API calls.
